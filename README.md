# Question-Answering-System

For this task I have used a pretrained model from hugging face.
Also I have built a simple API using FastAPI, where I have created a function that gets the context and question as input and returns the answer as the output.
To run this API I used the following command in the terminal : uvicorn main:app --reload and we get an interface where we can test the API.
I have also attached the demo video in the repository.
